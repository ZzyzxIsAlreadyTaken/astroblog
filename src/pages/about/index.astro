      <p>
        I'm a consultant at Atea, specializing in SharePoint and modern web
        development. My journey in tech started with SharePoint development back
        in 2012, where I initially focused on configuration, HTML, and CSS
        customizations. Aswell as server configuration and management as
        everything was on prem back then.
